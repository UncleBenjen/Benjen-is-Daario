	        <hr>
	        <div class="">
	        <p>Alright everybody, get ready for this one...</p>
	        
	        <p>This is going to seem farfetched but at least this theory hasn't been discussed yet so it will give you something to ponder! Before I continue I would like to say that this theory came to me after reading the books and as the books are not with me at work right now nothing is referenced and therefore some details could be off (although this isn’t so much as a line for line theory as a bigger idea right now).</p>
	        
	        <p>Benjen Stark's whereabouts always has intrigued me in large part because he went missing early on in the first novel and has yet to resurface.</p>
			
			<p>The first option for Benjen that most people (myself included) go to is that he is Coldhands. Easy enough right? The child of the forest disproves this in my eyes by implying that Coldhands has been around for a lot longer than Benjen has been missing for. We all know that GRRM likes to disguise his characters as other characters and no character is ever dead without a firsthand account. By this logic I will make the argument that no, Benjen is not frozen to death in a ditch North of the Wall but instead he is in disguise as another character we know.</p>
	        
	        <p>Well that raises a lot more questions since there are so many characters. Ones that can be ruled out immediately are people that would recognize Benjen. Therefore, he isn't with any of the Starks or with anyone familiar with the Stark family. Wow, that doesn't leave us many options now does it?</p>
	      
	        <div class="col-md-4">
	        	<a href="img/Benjen_Stark.jpg" class="fancybox thumbnail anchor-img-border" rel="group"><img class="img-float-left" src="img/Benjen_Stark.jpg"></a>
	        	<p class="img-footer-text"><a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Benjen_Stark" target="_blank">Benjen Stark</a>, depicted by Amok &copy</p>
	        </div>
	        <div class="col-md-8">
	        	<p>Before moving on with this I will also state that I believe Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar. Also, Benjen was said to be close with Lyanna and therefore I will make the biggest assumption of this theory (please don't condemn me for this one): Benjen Stark is aware that John is Lyanna's son and that Lyanna loved Rhaegar (also an assumption, I know). The justification for this is that if Lyanna didn't ever make her feelings towards Rhaegar known to Benjen, Ned would. Why would Ned? To me it seems like why wouldn't Ned? Benjen is family and would deserve to know the truth about his sister and since he is safe on the wall, Ned wouldn't be paranoid that Benjen could let it slip after a few too many brews at the family reunion.</p>
	        
	        	<p>Okay so to summarize where our thought process is right now:</p>
	        	<ul>
	        		<li>Benjen is alive and disguised as another character</li>
	        		<li>Benjen is aware of Lyanna's relationship with Rhaegar and her Targaryen sympathy (she chose Rhaegar over her own brother and father even if unintentionally)</li>
	       	 	</ul>
	        </div>
	        <p>Alright so back to who could Benjen be in disguise? As already demonstrated by Barristan, Dany is the perfect victim to be fooled for a character in disguise. She was raised in Essos and literally is not familiar with most of the characters in Westeros and she is willingly accepting help from strangers (from her perspective) for the most part. Therefore it is conceivable that Benjen is with Dany and she has no idea.</p>
	        
	        <p>The next question that this brings up is why would Benjen go to Dany? Here there is definitely room for interpretation so this next part is completely what I feel makes sense.</p>
	        
	        <p>Benjen is the First Ranger of the Nights Watch. He understands the true magnitude of the danger (the Others) that the Seven Kingdoms is about to be faced with. If Benjen was to learn about Dany and her dragons he could reason that they would be a huge help in the coming war against Ice. How did Benjen learn of Dany and her dragons though? Ships from Essos occasionally make their way North so that's possible. Information tends to move through Varys so maybe he even suggested it to Benjen as a part of his grand scheme. Or maybe Benjen saw her in the fire similar to the way others have (I know Benjen hasn't had any Fire Priest tendencies before but this could be an exception). If Benjen knew of Lyanna’s love for Rhaegar and that they had a child together he would be much more receptive to helping Dany.</p>
	        
	        <p>Okay, so if you've stuck with me to this point, Benjen possibly could have gone to Dany to help her and guide her to the wall where he knows she needs to be (by instinct, Varys or prophecy I don't know). Another side point to make is that Dany is unwillingly collecting a legendary assortment of individuals about her in preparation for her destiny. A Stark would definitely be an asset to her.</p>
	        
	        <p>Who then could Benjen be if indeed he went to Dany? This is where the theory materializes.</p>

	        <p>I think that Benjen Stark is undercover as <i>Daario Naharis</i>. I can hear some of your screams of denial already. Why Daario you ask? That seems completely random and improbable!!! Yes, maybe that is true or maybe there's more to meet the eye.</p>

	        <blockquote style="float:right; margin-left:15px;"><i>I'm sure many of you<br/>are still feeling like Daario<br/>was just a random guess<br/>of who Benjen could be<br/>and you're right, it is.</i></blockquote>
	        <p>First let's start with their appearances. Both seem to be of similar age and average build (warrior types smaller than the Hound/Mountain). Not saying much, I know, but at least they aren’t worlds apart. I believe both have blue eyes but once again I don’t have the book with me to quote anything. Both have beards and long hair (hardly a tell tale sign but still a match nonetheless). My next point convinces me the most however. Daario seems like he is in a disguise. Yes, technically all Tyroshi would seem that way but what better person for Benjen to pretend to be than a man that dyes his hair blue, has piercings and wears bright, distracting colors? One glance and you say "Oh that's a Tyroshi sell sword" and think nothing of it. If Benjen were to hide his appearance, a Tyroshi get up is the equivalent to a costume.</p>

	        <p>Alright so maybe these two guys look similar and maybe Benjen is posing as a Tyroshi sell sword as a disguise but how would it come about? The timeline seems to work for them both. Benjen disappeared early on and could have gone East and joined a mercenary band. He's a very capable fighter as are most Starks and particularly the First Ranger of the Night's Watch. Therefore it is believable that Benjen rose in the ranks of a mercenary group very quickly, just in time for Dany to come strolling along. The company had three leaders at the time so it seems as if the leaders are flexible and probably combat based (not as formal as the Golden Company per say). But before I continue on this thought let me jump away briefly.</p>
	        <div class="col-md-4">
	        	<a href="img/Daario_Naharis.jpg" class="fancybox thumbnail anchor-img-border" rel="group"><img class="img-float-left" src="img/Daario_Naharis.jpg"></a>
	        	<p class="img-footer-text"><a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daario_Naharis" target="_blank">Daario Naharis</a>, depicted by <a href="http://steamey.deviantart.com/">Steamey &copy</a></p>
	        </div>
	        <div class="col-md-8">
	        <p>I'm sure many of you are still feeling like Daario was just a random guess of who Benjen could be and you're right, it is. However, I have been suspicious of Daario right from the start. What are his motives? He meets Dany for the first time and immediately kills his fellow leaders to gain control of the mercenary band and support her. Why do this? Certainly sell swords are treacherous so the betrayal isn't the surprise but why betray his comrades to join Dany? She has dragons and she's hot and she has the makings of an army and potential to be Queen. If that's enough for you than you should stop reading this. If you are like me and you don't think it’s enough, let’s continue. A sell sword would want to see a return on his investment, in this case for supporting Dany. As Davos' pirate demonstrated, sell swords and pirates are typically not patient when it comes to compensation. Yet Daario is so patient and utterly loyal right from the beginning...... two characteristics that scream out to me as him being a fake sell sword!</p>
			</div>
			
	        <p>If Daario is Benjen in disguise, his rapid loyalty and support for Dany makes sense. Having sex with her seems like a random thing for Benjen to do but if she is as hot as she sounds and Benjen wants to earn her trust why not? I definitely would in his situation. </p>

	        <p>The next question one might have would be why would Benjen just abandon his brothers on the Night's Watch like this? He swore an oath to serve the realm until his death! Starks do not take oaths lightly. Well technically he still is keeping his oath. In fact, helping Dany and enlisting the best chance for help the Night's Watch has ever had is doing more for the realm than any of the boys freezing their dicks off on the wall. But why wouldn't he tell anyone? Well the Commander would probably argue he has more value on the wall than chasing a wannabe princess so faking his death would be the only option for an extended leave of absence like this. Once again, if Varys has a role in this, that would be the first thing he would suggest to do.</p>

	        <p>Another point is that Benjen's disappearance with Jon's arrival seems coincidental but what if it was intentional? It is said that a Stark must always be on the wall. Perhaps Benjen, knowing Jon's background and maybe he has some other insight as well about Jon's importance (Azor Ahai anyone?), needed to bring Jon to the wall prior to leaving to help Dany. Sure, some say that Benjen came to Winterfell due to the rarity and grandeur of the King coming North but there could be more to that as well. What if Benjen, privy to the fact that Robert was coming to drag Ned South, knew a visit to Jon would convince him to join him on the wall. By playing a little devil's advocate and saying the wall will always be there for him, he gambled that Jon would be more excited rather than deterred. Benjen might not have known for sure if it would work but maybe once Jon joined the Night's Watch so quickly Benjen was able to proceed with his bigger plans and head East.</p>

	        <p>So to summarize a bit, I think that Benjen Stark is Daario Naharis in disguise because:
	        <ol>
	        	<li>It is likely Benjen is alive and another character (GRRM's style).</li>
	        	<li>Dany is ignorant about the people in Westeros making Benjen joining her possible and also she is important making Benjen's purpose more plausible.</li>
	        	<li>Daario hasn't behaved like a typical sell sword would and his dyed beard and piercings would make a perfect disguise for Benjen.</li>
	        	<li>Benjen must have a bigger role to play in the grand scheme of things or he would have been found dead already. What bigger role could he have than helping Dany bring the dragons to the wall and save the Seven Kingdoms from the Others?</li>
	        	<li>I think that covers all I wanted to say AND I effectively wasted an hour at work. Double success. Let me know what you guys think if any of you have the heart or stomach to get through this and try not to ruthlessly rip it apart since I haven’t even reread the books with this theory in mind. Sorry for the length of the post but I wanted to convey all of my thoughts since this theory is walking on thin ice (pun intended).</li>
	        </ol>

	        <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Something to consider as well that I thought of after that some of you might find interesting would be that Benjen=Daario would have very strong parallels with Jon going undercover with the wildlings. Both had to abandon their brothers in a time of need for a greater cause, both had to lie about being brothers of the Nights Watch and both even had to forsake their vow to never have sex for the success of their missions (once again assuming Benjen/Daario did so in order to gain her trust and protect her). Also related to protecting her, if Benjen was a pawn of Varys maybe it was Varys' idea to gain a mercenary group so that Dany had more soldiers at her disposal for her protection.</p>
	        <p>Thanks everybody for the feedback and enthusiasm.</p>
